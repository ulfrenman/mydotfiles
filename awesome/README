When I upgraded to Ubuntu 18.04 awesome was upgraded to v4.2 (where I think I
was previously on v3.5). This introduced some issues for me. And while I was
fixing them I gatherd some knowledge that I will try to compile here.

awesome-client:
 * Use return instead of print:
    return "HelloWorld"

Todo:
 * Cycle through all windows with <modkey>-<tab>
 * New windows should not be masters by default
 * If there is more than 1 screen, make first tag on screen 1 IM tag with
   floating layout
 * Make gimp (and all its popups) always be floating by default
 * Show window state somewere (in popup window or tasklist??),
   beautiful.tasklist_plain_task_name seems to be related to this but I cant
   get it working.
 * Try testing and development using Xephyr:
