-- Some configuration of how psql behave. A good starter:
--   http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2013/02/21/more-out-of-psql/

-- Turn off autocommit and make transaction errors rollback just the last
-- statement.
\set AUTOCOMMIT OFF
\set ON_ERROR_ROLLBACK interactive

-- Print timing info after each query
\timing

-- Make the prompt red and bold
\set PROMPT1 '%001%[%033[1;31;40m%]%002%/%R%001%[%033[0m%]%002%x%x%# '

-- Alias
\set show_slow_queries 'SELECT (total_time / 1000 / 60) as total_minutes, (total_time/calls) as average_time, query, calls FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY 1 DESC LIMIT 100;'

-- Wrong place to put this I guess but I know I will find it here when I miss
-- it:
--   To run a query directly from within a vim-session do something like:
--     :w !psql eyedb
--     :'<,'>w !psql eyedb
--  In a psql-session I could edit the last query with vim with:
--     \e
