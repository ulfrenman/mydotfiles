-- Some configuration of how psql behave. A good starter:
--   http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2013/02/21/more-out-of-psql/

-- Turn off autocommit and make transaction errors rollback just the last
-- statement.
\set AUTOCOMMIT OFF
\set ON_ERROR_ROLLBACK interactive

-- Print timing info after each query
\timing

-- Make the prompt red and bold
\set PROMPT1 '%[%033[1;31;40m%]%/%R%[%033[0m%]%x%x%# '

-- Alias
\set show_slow_queries 'SELECT (total_time / 1000 / 60) as total_minutes, (total_time/calls) as average_time, query, calls FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY 1 DESC LIMIT 100;'

-- Wrong place to put this I guess but I know I will find it here when I miss
-- it:
--   To run a query directly from within a vim-session do something like:
--     :w !psql eyedb
--     :'<,'>w !psql eyedb
--  In a psql-session I could edit the last query with vim with:
--     \e

-- From: https://robots.thoughtbot.com/improving-the-command-line-postgres-experience
-- By default, NULL displays as an empty space. Is it actually an empty
-- string, or is it null? This makes that distinction visible.
\pset null '[NULL]'
-- Use table format (with headers across the top) by default, but switch to
-- expanded table format when there's a lot of data, which makes it much
-- easier to read.
\x auto
-- Verbose error reports.
\set VERBOSITY verbose
-- Use a separate history file per-database.
\set HISTFILE ~/.psql_history- :DBNAME
-- If a command is run more than once in a row, only store it once in the
-- history.
\set HISTCONTROL ignoredups
-- Autocomplete keywords (like SELECT) in upper-case, even if you started
-- typing them in lower case.
\set COMP_KEYWORD_CASE upper
